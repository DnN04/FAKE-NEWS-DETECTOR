# 📰 Fake News Detector using BERT and Classical ML

A Machine Learning + NLP-based Fake News Detection system that classifies news headlines as **REAL** or **FAKE** using both:
- ✅ A Classical Model (TF-IDF + PassiveAggressiveClassifier)
- ✅ A Transformer Model (BERT fine-tuned for classification)

## 📊 Dataset

We use the widely known **"Fake and Real News Dataset"** containing:
- `Fake.csv` – 23,000+ fake news articles
- `True.csv` – 21,000+ real news articles

Both files are stored in the `data/` folder.
